This is a simple teleportation plugin, it was made for
my public server as I have a thing for realism and
/warp just does not do. This allows you to create signs
to act as destinations and other ones to be used by the
players, when you right click on a travel sign you are
teleported to its destination. There are no commands,
see the examples on the wiki for how to use it.
